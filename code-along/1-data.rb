# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
puts 4
puts 2

# Perform simple math with numbers

puts 6 + 2
puts 6 / 2
puts 6 * 2
puts 6 - 2
puts 3.0/2.0
puts 7 % 4

# Strings

puts "Hello, world"

# Combine strings together

puts "Hello," + " world"

puts "Tacos " * 3

# The opposite does not work: puts 3 * "Tacos"

# Variables

food = "Tacos"
number = 3 

puts food
puts number
puts food * number

number = 5 

puts food * number

# Combine strings and variables

greeting = "heyyyy"
puts "#{greeting}, world"
puts 
# String manipulation

puts welcome_message.reverse
